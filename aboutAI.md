What is AI?
1. Make predicitons
2. Understand complex patterns
3. Tries simulate how the human brain works

We made AI/Machine Learning Predictive Model
* Makes predictions based on known data
    * Therefore we need Data

Once the data was retrieved, we needed to format
1. Make it easier to code with
2. Make it easier to read/see visually
3. Make it easier to comprehend
Ex. Removing columns, making sure all the cells have some value, pciked out the important features that were relevant to our model

A few basic models that were used include
1. Linear Regression()
2. Random Forest Regressor()
3. Support Vector Regression()

JUST BECAUSE YOU CAN CREATE A MACHINE LEARNING ALGOROITHM WITH DATA... DOES NOT MEAN THAT THE MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHM YOU CREATED IS GOOD

To ensure credebility of you algorithm... we did a Train-test-split
* train test split, separates the data into a training and testing set
    * the training set will be used to creat the model
    * the testing set will be used to test the created model

Now we "fit" the collected data, onto the basic machine learning models (linear, rd, ssvr)

After fitting the data, the model is now trained based on the data we "fit" into it

Now we can use that model to make predictions

QUESTIONS
1. What can you do to improve the accuracy machine learning algorithm?


2. Can a machine learning algorithm output more than 1 result?


3. How would you implement a machine learning model into a game (the AI of an NPC that gets harder the longer you play)?
